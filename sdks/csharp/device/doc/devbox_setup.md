## Sample applications

This repository contains various .NET sample applications that illustrate how to use the Microsoft Azure IoT device SDK for .NET. For more information, see the [readme][readme].

## Building for iOS and Android using C#  
For building for iOS and Android using C#, you need to install [Xamarin][lnk-visualstudio-xamarin] for VS 2015

For building iOS sample, open **csharp\device\samples\DeviceClientSampleiOS** project file in VS 2015. You will be prompted to install Xamarin to build native iOS apps in C# if tool is not installed. Install the tool. You can test the sample on iPhone simulator running on your Mac.

For building Android sample open **csharp\device\samples\DeviceClientSampleAndroid** VS project file in VS 2015. You will be prompted to install Xamarin to build native Android apps in C# if tool is not installed. Install the tool. You can test the sample on Android emulator running on you host PC.

To check for any latest Xamarin update for Visual Studio check Tools->Options->Xamarin->Other.

## Running CppUWPSample (Universal Windows) sample application

Visual Studio is having an issue with getting all the depedencies (dll) of the Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client.WinRT which is referenced in the project to the proper location.  This leads to an exception thrown about not loading file or assembly during run-time.  You will have to manually copy the dlls in the appropriate location in order to run the sample application successfully.  Follow the below steps if needed:
* Build the UWPSample (Universal Windows) project
* Note the location of the bin folder, i.e. ...\azure-iot-sdks\csharp\device\samples\UWPSample\bin\x86\Debug\
* Build the CppUWPSample (Universal Windows) project
* Note the location of the Appx folder, i.e. ...\azure-iot-sdks\csharp\device\Debug\CppUWPSample\Appx
* Copy all dll files from the UWPSample bin folder to the CppUWPSample Appx folder.  When prompt about duplicated file names, choose "Skip these files"

Now you are ready to run the CppUWPSample.
